# Prompt-Engineering
Prompt engineering is a process of designing and implementing prompts that help guide users through a particular task or workflow. The prompts are designed to be clear, concise, and easy to understand, in order to help users navigate complex processes or systems. Examples of prompt engineering can be found in various areas, such as setting up a new computer or designing online forms. By using effective prompts, designers can help users complete tasks more quickly and accurately, ultimately improving the overall user experience.

# The core elements of prompt engineering:

### 1. Intention:
This refers to the designer's intended goal or purpose for the prompt. The designer must have a clear understanding of what the prompt is meant to achieve and how it fits into the broader user experience.

### 2. Creation:
This involves designing the prompt itself, including its wording, format, and placement within the user interface. The prompt should be clear, concise, and easy to understand, and should provide users with the information they need to complete the task at hand.

### 3. Evaluation: 
This involves testing and refining the prompt to ensure that it is effective in achieving its intended purpose. The designer should gather feedback from users and make any necessary adjustments to improve the prompt's clarity and effectiveness
